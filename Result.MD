# Featured-vendors_Google_Search 

## Two Settings

### We run the web search in two settings:

* Using only “AWS” as a key word to represent Amazon Web Services (1), and another setting is to search both “AWS” and “Amazon Web Services” (2).

* Under setting (1), we find that the Google Cloud is the top 1 SP, there are 94 out of 132 targets. Within 29 true positive results, 24 are from Google Cloud customers. (please check the results table here)

* Under setting (2), we find that the AWS is the top 1 SP, there are 121 out of 132 targets. Within 22 true positive results, 20 are from Google Cloud customers. (please check the results table here)

## Conclusion

### Based on the results above, we are very hard to tell the google search result page #s are good on verifying which cloud service provider is the primary one. In the situation that we need to make differentiate between multiple vendors, the task becomes more challenger.
