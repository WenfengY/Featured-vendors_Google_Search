#  - - Data driven leveraging Google Search API for strength of association - e.g. Netflix and AWS
# Goal: using Google Web Search Page # Results to verify that which service provider (SP) is the primary
#      one
# Idea: to find a way to automate the capture of whenever a vendor / technology organization features
# a user organization.
# Steps: 
# 1. identify standard customer pages on vendor (cloud service provider) companies' website to find
#     customers, and form a list of 126 for 6 vendors (AWS, Azura, Google Could, Oracle Cloud, IBM Cloud, 
#     Alibaba Cloud)
# 2. using Python Library selenium as major tool for headless web searching tool to search and parse 
#    the result pages, recoding search result # for 6 vendors
# 3. based on the #s for each customer, calculate the weights/percentages for all 6 vendors
#    and pick the top one as the major SP for comparison
# 4.  Verify our hypothesis: the google search result page #s represent the SP association levels
